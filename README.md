Optimizing Patient Waitlist Insights with Power BI 

I recently worked on a healthcare analytics report focusing on patient waiting lists, analyzing key trends for both inpatient and outpatient cases. By leveraging Power BI and DAX, I built an interactive dashboard offering actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and decision-making. Here's a quick breakdown of my work:

> Summary Page Highlights:
1️⃣ Key Metrics in Cards
Latest Month Wait List
Previous Year Wait List
Leveraged DAX measures like:
Latest Month Wait List
PY Latest Month Wait List
2️⃣ User-Friendly Design:
Enabled Gridlines and Snap to Grid for perfect alignment of visuals.
Created a button slicer to toggle between Average and Median waitlist metrics, powered by DAX:
Avg/Med Wait List
Dynamic Titles to reflect selected calculation.
3️⃣ Visuals for Key Insights:
Doughnut Chart: Proportion of patient types.
Clustered Column Chart: Monthly trends in waitlist numbers.
Top Five Multi-Row Card: Focus on specialties with the highest waitlist.
4️⃣ Custom Messages for Missing Data:
Added conditional messages to inform users about unavailable data, ensuring clarity.
5️⃣ Time-Series Line Chart:
Plotted Total Waitlist over time, segmented by Case Type (Day Case, Inpatients, Outpatients).

> Detailed View:
For deeper exploration, I added a matrix view to show:
Archive Date, Specialty Name, Age Profile, Time Bands, Case Type, and Total Waitlist.
This enables stakeholders to dive into granular data and identify trends across specific parameters.

> Key Insights Uncovered:
1️⃣ Outpatient Waitlists: A significant rise in the last 12 months compared to the previous year.
2️⃣ Specialty Trends: Certain specialties account for a disproportionate share of the waitlist – perfect targets for resource allocation.
3️⃣ Age Profile Impact: Younger patients had shorter wait times, while older demographics faced longer delays.

> Tools & Techniques:
Power BI Design Best Practices: Used alignment tools and slicers for intuitive navigation.
DAX Calculations: Created dynamic measures for deeper insights and better interactivity.
This report demonstrates how data-driven insights can transform patient care by identifying bottlenecks, improving resource allocation, and ensuring timely interventions.
